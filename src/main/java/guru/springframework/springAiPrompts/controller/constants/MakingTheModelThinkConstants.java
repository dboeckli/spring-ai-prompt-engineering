        In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on
        a quest to fetch water from a hilltop well.
        As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune
        struckâ€”Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled
        down the hill, with Jill following suit.
        Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to
        comforting embraces. Despite the mishap,
        their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they
        continued exploring with delight.

        You are an expert at solving reasoning problems. A cup is an object with an open top and close on the sides and bottom.
        The open top does not prevent objects from passing through it.
        
        Assume the laws of physics on Earth. A small marble is put into a normal cup and the cup is placed upside down on a
        table, causing the open side of the cup to be in contact with the table. Gravity will cause the ball to fall to the table.
        Someone then picks the cup up without changing its orientation and puts it inside the microwave. Where is the ball
        now. Determine the position of the ball in each step. Explain
        why the ball is positioned where it is.
        
        At the end of your explanation, format a single line starting with "SOLUTION:" that states very briefly where the ball is located.
